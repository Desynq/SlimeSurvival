# Disclaimer

This mod breaks probably over a dozen licenses and gives no credit to any mod authors from whom I've stolen code from.

As such, I present this repository as a way for me to track my own commit history in case I need to do a rollback at some point or view old code to cringe at.

I do NOT condone the stealing of mod authors' work in order to make revenue or otherwise illicitly reupload their mods in full.
This is simply a "collage" of different modder's work with some of my own and egregious amounts of duct tape and glue rivaling that of a high school art project.


# Compiling

If you wish to compile this mod, I suggest you don't since it'll probably break a lot of things if you don't follow its `build.gradle` and `gradle.properties` to a tee.
