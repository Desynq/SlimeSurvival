# Disclaimer

This mod breaks probably over a dozen licenses and gives no credit to any mod authors from whom I've stolen code from.

As such, I present this repository as a way for me to track my own commit history in case I need to do a rollback at some point or view old code to cringe at.

I do NOT condone the stealing of mod authors' work in order to make revenue or otherwise illicitly reupload their mods in full.
This is simply a "collage" of different modder's work with some of my own and egregious amounts of duct tape and glue rivaling that of a high school art project.

# Credits

- DragonLoot
	- I stole a lot of your code for my registries
- MultiBossbarFix
	- I literally copied your single mixin and transplanted it into my mod for 1.18.2
- Things
	- I used your `ExtendableTooltipProvider` as "inspiration" for my own tooltip provider that supports `\n` in tooltip translation keys
- Mob Origins
	- I literally copied your mixin for the bouncy effect



# Additional Notes

- I suggest using CraftTweaker to remove Artifact's NVGs and Snorkel from the item tag `trinkets:head/hat` so that they can only be equipped on the face trinket slot lol
