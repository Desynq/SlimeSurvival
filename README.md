## Disclaimer

This mod breaks probably over a dozen licenses and gives no credit to a large portion of the mod authors from whom I've stolen code from (largely because I've forgotten most of the people I've stolen code/assets from at this point).

As such, I present this repository as a way for me to track my own commit history in case I need to do a rollback at some point or view old code to cringe at.

I do NOT condone the stealing of mod authors' work in order to make revenue or otherwise illicitly reupload their mods in full.
This is simply a "collage" of different modder's work with some of my own and egregious amounts of duct tape and glue rivaling that of a high school art project.
